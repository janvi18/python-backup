Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted programming language. 
It supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. 
It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.

Features : 
- Easy to use and Learn

Date Types:

1. Numbers --. int,float,complex number
2. Sequence Type --> string,list,tuple
3. Boolean 
4. Set 
5. Dictionary

Comments : 

single line --> #
multi line --> ''''''



Operators:

Arithmetic operators --> + - * / %
Comparison operators --> == != <= >= < >
Assignment Operators --> =  += -= 
Logical Operators --> and or not 
Bitwise Operators --> binary
Membership Operators --> in notin 
Identity Operators --> is isnot


Loops:

While loop --> Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is TRUE. 
               It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
For loop --> This type of loop executes a code block multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
Nested loops --> We can iterate a loop inside another loop.

Loop Control Statements:

Break statement	--> terminates the loop's execution and transfers the program's control to the statement next to the loop.
Continue statement --> This command skips the current iteration of the loop. 
                       continue statement are not executed once the Python interpreter reaches the continue statement.
Pass statement	--> The pass statement is used when a statement is syntactically necessary, but no code is to be executed.
